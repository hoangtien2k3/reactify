/**
 * <p>
 * Factory class for providing a singleton instance of
 * {@link org.modelmapper.ModelMapper}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to provide a single, globally accessible
 * {@link org.modelmapper.ModelMapper} instance, which can be reused across the
 * application for object mapping tasks. This approach optimizes performance by
 * avoiding the creation of multiple {@link org.modelmapper.ModelMapper}
 * instances.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * ModelMapper mapper = ModelMapperFactory.getInstance();
 * DestinationObject dest = mapper.map(sourceObject, DestinationObject.class);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This singleton instance is thread-safe as the
 * {@link org.modelmapper.ModelMapper} class itself is designed for concurrent
 * use.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see ModelMapper
 * @see <a href="https://modelmapper.org/">ModelMapper Documentation</a>
