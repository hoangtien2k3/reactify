/**
 * <p>
 * Indicates that a method should be logged when it is executed. This annotation
 * can be used to track method calls, parameters, and return values, which is
 * useful for debugging and monitoring application behavior.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This annotation is typically processed by an aspect-oriented programming
 * (AOP) framework that intercepts method calls and performs the logging.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Usage Example:</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Loggable
 * public void performAction(String parameter) {
 * 	// Method implementation
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> The actual logging behavior must be configured
 * separately in the application, depending on the logging framework in use.
 * </p>
