/**
 * <p>
 * The Abstract SagaProcess class provides a template for executing a series of
 * steps in a saga pattern. It defines the structure for saga execution and
 * rollback procedures. Subclasses must implement the {@link #getSteps()} method
 * to provide the specific steps that make up the saga.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class utilizes Reactor's reactive programming model, allowing for
 * non-blocking execution of the saga steps and handling of potential errors
 * during execution. It ensures that if any step fails, the process is rolled
 * back to maintain data consistency.
